# Deploy contract


### How to deploy
1. Make sure all `node_modules` dependencies are installed
2. Set env variables in the `.env` file
3. Cleanup previous builds if they exist
4. Build & test contracts locally
5. Deploy library contract with Hardhat
6. Deploy exchange contract with Hardhat
7. Verify library contract code on Etherscan
8. Verify exchange contract code on Etherscan
9. Set minimum fee
10. Done ðŸ˜Š

### Supported networks

- `local`
- `marsbase`
- `rinkeby`
- `mainnet`

## Deployment

### 1. Install deps

```shell
yarn
```

It's best to cleanup first, and to install with frozen lockfile:

```shell
rm -rf node_modules
yarn --frozen-lockfile
```

### 3. Cleanup previous builds if they exist

```shell
rm -rf ./artifacts ./cache
```

### 4. Build & test contracts locally

```shell
yarn test
```

### 5. Deploy Marsbase Library contract

```shell
yarn hardhat deploy-lib --network marsbase
```

### 6. Deploy Marsbase Exchange contract

```shell
yarn hardhat deploy-exchange --library <LIBRARY_ADDRESS> --network marsbase
```

### (optional) Deploy both contracts in one line

```shell
yarn hardhat deploy-all --network marsbase
```

### 7. Verify Marsbase Library source code on Etherscan

```shell
yarn hardhat verify --network mainnet <LIBRARY_ADDRESS>
```

### 8. Verify Marsbase Exchange source code on Etherscan

```shell
yarn hardhat verify --network mainnet <EXCHANGE_ADDRESS>
```

### 9. Set minimum fee

```
yarn hardhat set-minimum-fee --library <LIBRARY_ADDRESS> --exchange <EXCHANGE_ADDRESS> --fee 0.5% --network marsbase
```
